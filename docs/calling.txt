sgcomp and all of its subprojects use a custom calling convention, specified here:
- integer arguments are passed in a and b (or, in case of being 16-bit, d)
- pointer arguments are passed in x and y
- extra arguments of any kind may use unused arguments of other kinds, or u whenever that's not enough
- all registers not used as arguments must be preserved by the callee
- return values are passed in a when 8-bit and d when 16-bit

for commenting function declarations in assembly code, follow this structure:
```
; (function name): (description)
; 
; - (register 1): (argument 1)
; - (register 2): (argument 2)
; ...
; returns:
; - (register): (return value)
(function name):
  (code)
  rts
```

in case of not having any return values, the "returns:" line is omitted.

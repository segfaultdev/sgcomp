sgboot stores system data in certain predefined addresses (assuming the system page map is active):
- 0x0000 - 0x0800 -> sgboot stack
- 0x0800 - 0x0BFF -> task list (up to 32 tasks, each 32 bytes)
- 0x0C00 - 0x0FFF -> syscall list
- 0x1000          -> current task ID
- 0x1001          -> 

the page allocator the task code uses won't make the first 3 pages available
